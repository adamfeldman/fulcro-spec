0.1.1
-----

- Added support for new macros:
    - `when-mocking`: Just like `provided`, but without output (no string parameter)
    - `component`: Alias for `behavior`. Makes specs read better.
- `behavior` macro now supports :manual-test as a body, which will indicate that the test requires a human to do the steps.
